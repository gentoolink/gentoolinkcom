### Cloud Computing with Nextcloud Hosting

Nextcloud provides online file sharing without any need of a Microsoft or
Google licence.

> People have to get work done and new generations of employees know what tools they want. So they share documents as mail attachments to Gmail addresses, use Trello or share with Dropbox. The question is not "to Cloud or not to Cloud" but "which Cloud?" and "how to re-gain control?"

###Secure Websites

I can create a website for you. I am currently specializing in secure static websites. Static websites are more secure and cost less to host than database driven websites like WordPress.

Most small businesses only require a brochure style website. These type of websites usually
do not require frequent updates so are quite suitable for static website architecture.

The important thing is you have a website that fits your needs. And everyone's needs
are unique. Let's get together to discuss your needs. I am based out of Maple Ridge, BC.

#### Hosting

Hosting and [Let's Encrypt SSL](https://letsencrypt.org/) is provided with hosting services. ***Extra fees may apply.***

#### Social Media Setup
If you do not have a prescence on social media in 2018...you need one for 2019.
Facebook is part of that solution;but not the only solution. A Facebook page should not be
an alternative to your own website.

##Pay triubute to a loved one who has passed with a dedicated website

### Memorial Website

Memorial websites can be great way to immortalize your loved one who has passed.

Although there are free options a unique website dedicated to your loved one's memory is an option.

### Memorial Tribute Video

I can create a tribute video for your loved one who has passed. This is better than a Power Point. I will make a video from your digital or scanned photographs and set it to music. This video can then be shared on a unique website or social media.

> Online memorials allow participation in the grieving process from a distance and at any time of the day or night; in the view of some sociologists, such public displays of grief are important for emotional recovery after bereavement. They provide a communications outlet for continued grieving when more formal events have ended. Availability of inexpensive or free online space allows grievers to include extensive content such as stories and discussions. Unlike some other types of memorials, they have little environmental impact.  --Wikipedia
