I can create a website for you. I am currently specializing in secure static websites.
The important thing is you have a website that fits your needs. Let's get together
to discuss your needs. I am based out of Maple Ridge, BC.

### Cloud Computing with Nextcloud Hosting

Nextcloud provides online file sharing without any need of a Microsoft or
Google licence.

> People have to get work done and new generations of employees know what tools they want. So they share documents as mail attachments to Gmail addresses, use Trello or share with Dropbox. The question is not "to Cloud or not to Cloud" but "which Cloud?" and "how to re-gain control?"

An Enterprise File Sync and Share solution that keeps data under control.

Your employees need to have easy access to their files, photos and documents to work and share with team members, customers and partners. And IT needs to know nobody besides those they shared with has access to those files.

Nextcloud Files is a self-hosted, open source file sync and share solution designed to be easy-to-use and highly secure.

### Memorial Website

Memorial websites can be great way to immortalize your loved one who has passed.
I setup an online memorial for my mother when she passed away.

### Memorial Tribute Video

I can create a tribute video for your loved one who has passed. This is better than
a Power Point. I will make a video from your digital or scanned photographs and set it to
music. This video can then be shared on a unique website or social media.

> Online memorials allow participation in the grieving process from a distance and at any time of the day or night; in the view of some sociologists, such public displays of grief are important for emotional recovery after bereavement. They provide a communications outlet for continued grieving when more formal events have ended. Availability of inexpensive or free online space allows grievers to include extensive content such as stories and discussions. Unlike some other types of memorials, they have little environmental impact.  --Wikipedia

Although there are free options a unique website dedicated to your loved one's memory
is an option.
