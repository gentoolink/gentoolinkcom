I enjoy helping people achieve thier goals. I enjoy working with computers
and solving problems. I am also a former police officer. I was in law enforcement for 12 years.

I currently do IT contracts for such clients as
[The Salvation Army](https://ridgemeadowssa.ca/) and [CanbikeBC](http://canbikebc.ca). So far I wear most of the hats; but that is going to change in the future. I have been working with computers professionally for the last 15 years both as a part time and full time business . I have been helping businesses with their professional web presence for over 6 years. You can visit my [Linkedin profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenmcgonigal/)
