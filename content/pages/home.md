###This is what customers have to say about Gentoolink Web Services

>>"I have worked with Ken McGONIGAL and gentoolink for several years.  I can totally attest to Ken’s professionalism, high moral standards, his confidentially, and his discression.
Ken, and gentoolink are incredible with computers, building systems, rebuilding systems, assisting with systems, recovering information and data.  He is able to listen to the client and assist in trouble shooting problems, both real and imagined by clients , with respect.
His ability at digital imaging, video, and forensic video, both new and older platforms and system versions is at a very high level, along with little used platforms.
Ken has assisted me and my company with all our computer and computer relates computer needs.  He has also assisted in designing and redesigning my company’s website along with updating the company  Logo.  Ken assisted with my web site from conception to up on line.
I will go nowhere else for anything computer related.  When it comes to computers, On so-so days Ken is very very good, on good days he’s THE BEST."
