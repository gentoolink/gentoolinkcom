The Internet has fundamentally changed nearly every aspect of our lives.
 From how we communicate with friends, family, coworkers, and businesses, a technology that was in its infancy just 25 years ago is now considered indispensable to many people.
 When you are running a business this is especially true.
Are you looking for help to develop your next web app project?
Your business needs a web presence today. You need more than a Facebook slash page!
Stop building Zuck’s website and build your own web application.
Although there certainly is room for a custom static site. I will build what you need and want.


I also support installation of several open source software solutions such as Nextcloud for secure file sharing and collaboration.
### Let’s discuss how I can help you with your next project.
