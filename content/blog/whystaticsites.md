Summary: The reasons to use a static website.



##Why use a static website? What is a static website?

These days it is quite simple to automatically use WordPress or some
other content management system (CMS). The question is what kind of
business are you in? Does your business need a CMS like WordPress?

Most small businesses may only need a static website to list thier
business on the internet. Will you be using your website to collect data?

***What is the difference between a static website and a CMS or WordPress?***

###Static:

- Speed in incredibly fast!
- The content stays the same.
- No database.
- More secure as there is no database to hack.

###CMS:

- content is dynamic and changes regularily
- Uses database
- Not as fast due to server and database calls
- Can be updated by users with different security levels

***What are your business needs?***

Will your business website change much after it is created? If the answer is
no then a static website is preferred.

Will your business website need frequent (daily or weekly) updates and changes?
Then  a CMS like WordPress makes more sense.

The bottom line is your website needs to be improving your business by
increasing leads and revenue. So your website needs to be as unique as your and
your business are.

Don't settle for just a Facebook page or a do-it-yourself website building service.
Get it done right with a professional so you have more time to work on what you are
good at--your busines!
