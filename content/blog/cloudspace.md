Summary: Do you need personal cloud space? How about private cloud space? Not Dropbox.


# The Revolution of the cloud has started

I am sure by now in 2018 you have heard of the cloud. 

Five Reasons to own and control your cloud:

    Privacy
    Cost
    Upgrade-ability
    Flexibility
    Space

There are a few ways you can own your own cloud space. No  I am not talking about iCloud or Dropbox. Both iCloud and Dropbox require a paid subscription to really use them for all your data syncing across devices.  Although these services are superb; if you like your privacy you may want to reconsider where you store your personal files. Remember when services are free…you are the product. You can also control where your files are stored and have more space for lower cost per gigabyte.

There are a few ways you can accomplish owning your cloud.

    Purchase hardware
    Purchase hosting
    Cloud hosting software

I have setup my own cloud which includes full encryption via ssl and all the files on the server are encrypted as well. So even if someone were to gain physical or logical access to the server they would not be able to read the files. Owncloud enables me to use a combination of data storage. I have my cloud hosted from a VPS and also storing files to AWS S3. All files are encrypted so it is secure.

So how can you get started you ask? If you are tech savvy you could buy your own hardware like a small NAS server with cloud software and host it from your home or office. Or you could purchase a Virtual Private Server (VPS) from a hosting provider like Amazon, Hostgator or Open Stack etc… Then use Owncloud to host your cloud. You will need a domain and ssl certificate to get started.

The advantage of using a service like VPS or AWS is the uptime is almost 100%. If you have a server in your home or office the power source could be interrupted and your cloud will be down as well. Also you have to think about physical security. If you suffered a home break in or office break in you could loose your precious data. Large hosting companies usually have physical security in their data centers. And you can access and manage a VPS or EC2 instance just as easy as if the computer was in your home.

If you purchase hardware it will eventually need an upgrade. While a VPS has a yearly cost you don’t need to worry about replacing hardware when it breaks down.

If you are not tech savvy; but still would like your own cloud then hiring a consultant would be the best option. If you have any suggestions or questions leave a comment below. I am also available for hire if you would like an Owncloud installation done for you.
