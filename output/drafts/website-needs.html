		<div><p>There are a few items you need to buy when building a website.  The very first thing you need to buy is a domain name. Without a domain name your website will not be visible on the internet.</p>
<h2>Choose a Domain Name</h2>
<p>There are several vendors who can sell you a domain name. I am recommending Namecheap.com as this is the vendor I deal with on a regular basis. You also have to check if your domain name is available. If you make your domain name unique to your business or blog then it should be available. You can also consider buying a top level domain other than .COM. There are several new TLD to choose from now. For example if your business is photography you can buy yourbusiness.photography. This is changing the traditional internet TLD names like .com etc...</p>
<h2>Choose a Hosting Provider</h2>
<p>You will need a hosting package. Hosting is where the actual website files live. This place is a computer called a server. These servers are located in very large data centers owned by large companies. I use Hostgator.com where I rent a VPS to host websites for my clients. I also host my own websites on the same server. There are many hosting companies out there to choose from. mainflyerbanner</p>
<h2>Do I need a SSL Certificate?</h2>
<p>You may also need to buy an SSL certificate. If your website requires users to login or buy things from a store then you will need to secure it with a SSL certificate. A SSL certificate is a set of keys to enable encryption between computers communicating on the internet. SSL certificates can vary in price depending on what you need it for. Most people just can buy a $20 SSL certificate without worries.</p>
<h2>Do I need a web developer?</h2>
<p>You will need a web developer. If you are not a tech savvy person then you need to hire someone. The price varies on what type of website you want or need. If you just need a brochure type of website it is usually less labor intensive. If you require an online store with ways for customers to shop and buy from your website this costs considerably more. A brochure type website is usually about five pages with pictures. An E-commerce website is usually allot larger. You definitely need to hire someone for  an E-commerce website.</p>
<p>Should I use a free website for my business?</p>
<p>I believe the best answer for this question is...don't you want a great website? Don't you want a website which doesn't look like everyone else's free website? Free website builders are limited in features. The main feature I would like to mention is the ability to have user logins and a private website which is commonly called  a "Walled Garden".</p>
<h2>Social Media</h2>
<p>You should also setup a page on Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter and Facebook. These powerful social media platforms will give your website exposure. If you are not sure how to do this you can always ask your website developer how to to this.  The power of social media and its viral qualities cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Your new website will also need to be optimized for the search engines to find it. If you have any questions or comments feel free to use the contact page.</p></div>
